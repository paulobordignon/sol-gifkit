GIFT KIT - A Solana program
</p>

The main difference between Solana programs and Ethereum smart contracts is programs are stateless. In a smart contract is possible to keep the state registering data in a variable. In a Solana program, the users have a lot of accounts, and the programs can communicate with these accounts registering data about the program.

Execution Instruction:

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies;
