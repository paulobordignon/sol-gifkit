GIFT KIT - A Solana program
</p>

About:

This project is a public gifs repository where every user can contribute by sending a new gif and seeing all gifs already published. All of this is public on Solana blockchain using Devnet network. See in: https://explorer.solana.com/address/AxBKG2ku3PqVYfQp9rZBU4tuNDLjZ7dxLxJqC8MndTe3?cluster=devnet

The main difference between Solana programs and Ethereum smart contracts is programs are stateless. In a smart contract is possible to keep the state registering data in a variable. In a Solana program, the users have a lot of accounts, and the programs can communicate with these accounts registering data about the program.

Execution Instruction:

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies;
2. Run `npm run start` to start the project.
